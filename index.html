            <h2>A bit about myself</h2>
            <p>I am currently a student studying in more theoretical subjects as Maths and Physics. Since my childhood, I have been a very curious kid always interested in knowing how things work and how I can improve it. My interest in programming arose with the help of a friend who told me that I should start programming because I would love it and I do love it. Unfortunately, due to some investement in school subjects I have had to stop for a while but now I am more invested than ever to retry. The languages I am most interested in are : html, css, php, python and, last but not least, c++.</p>

        <div class="Goals">
            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <p>I am currently trying to regain my skills as a programmer and progress to a new level on my own. As this will be the activity of my free time, it will take some time but I am dedicated. The goals of this website are two fold. First, this website is a way for me to express myself on my journey to try to become at least a mere intermediate programmer. It is a way for myself to come back at this when I need motivation and keep track of my progress. Secondly, this website is in itself a proof of my programming capacity, skills. Therefore, this website represents in itself my progress and becomes a motivator as I have said.</p>

            <p>In this part of the website I will keep track of all programming projects I have done. For those interested, I will post the link to my github page for each projects so you can learn more about it.</p>
